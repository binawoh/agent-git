# agit

This fork's headless, single-user Hub work lives on the `selfhost` branch.
See [the private Hub build and deployment guide](selfhost/RUNBOOK.md).
The backend implementation is in `crates/agit-selfhost`. Fork changes stay in this
repository; no upstream pull request is planned.

Lossless version control for every agent session: publishable, resumable.
Works with Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Cursor.

On disk, sessions are just JSONL files that get overwritten, compacted, and
cleaned up at any moment. `agit` puts snapshots and versions on top of them,
so "that conversation last Wednesday that finally cracked the bug" becomes
something you can find, continue, and hand to a teammate.

```text
agit                              choose a session to continue
agit new                          choose a repo and name a fresh conversation
agit import                       choose an existing runtime conversation to adopt
agit log                          choose a session and browse its history
agit push                         choose a saved session to publish
agit share                        choose a session and review link settings
agit run owner/repo@ref           open a saved source, forking when needed
```

These bare commands open their interfaces in a human terminal. `agit resume`
continues the same session and never forks; `agit run` can start a new writable
session from a tag, historical point or another author's source.

Inside an adopted agent session, `agit commit` saves completed turns and
`agit push` publishes that session. For scripts, pass the target explicitly,
for example `agit push owner/repo@branch --json`. Directory branch pins do not
choose targets for `commit`, `push` or `share`.

On user-facing startup, `agit` checks for a newer release at most once a day and prints a
reminder to stderr; it never upgrades automatically. JSON/quiet/CI and internal hook/MCP paths
skip this reminder.

Adopting and recording the first version are one command — the in-between
state ("linked, but unversioned") means nothing to anyone. To mark a session
without versioning it (e.g. offline), pass `--link-only`.

Use a full native session ID and an explicit runtime and destination for lineage discovery.
The terminal offers verified local bases, independent import, or cancellation. Noninteractive
calls return choices without writing; pass `--onto <ref>` or `--independent` to select a path.
`--propose-lineage` prints a read-only report without adopting the session.
Inspecting lineage in an existing repository requires NUL-framed Git worktree output,
normally available in Git 2.36 or newer. An unsupported Git reports `git_worktree_format`;
explicit `--onto`, `--independent`, and `--link-only` imports retain their ordinary checks.

`agit clone` fetches repository history locally. Use `agit run` or `agit resume`
to start a runtime. A clone is **read-only by default** on the Hub: nothing is
created in your name and `origin` points at the source. `agit clone --mine`
creates your copy, repoints `origin` and remembers the source as `upstream`.

The full command list is in `agit --help`.

## Install

### Users: npm

```sh
npx -y create-agit                 # one-shot: installs agit + wires skills/hooks/MCP
# or as a global package:
npm install -g @einsia/agent-git   # pnpm add -g @einsia/agent-git works too
agit --version
```

Both routes install a prebuilt binary — no Rust toolchain required. npm
picks the platform sub-package matching your `os`/`cpu`; on platforms with no
prebuilt binary (e.g. FreeBSD) running `agit` prints the source-build recipe.
Details and environment variables: [`npm/README.md`](npm/README.md).

Windows x64 packages include the native peer RC daemon. On Windows, Linux and macOS, run
`agit login` followed by `agit rc start --detach` to register the device and allow your own
account to control it from Workspaces. Windows owner RPC uses a local named pipe restricted
to the current user. RC state requires a private, user-owned directory.

pnpm (v10+) does not run dependency install scripts by default, so the
automatic `agit setup` is skipped there — run `agit setup` once yourself
after installing.

The Linux artifact is **musl static-linked**, so no minimum glibc — the
release pipeline runs every Linux binary inside an Alpine / Amazon Linux /
Debian / Ubuntu container matrix before publishing.

Prebuilt binaries include Git and Git LFS, extracted into a private cache on first
use. Your shell PATH and global Git configuration stay unchanged. Source builds
use system Git; `AGIT_USE_SYSTEM_GIT=1` selects it in a prebuilt binary too.
See [runtime configuration and source prerequisites](docs/01_setup.md).

> Do not install `@einsia/agentgit` (no hyphen) — that is the pre-rewrite
> CLI; its protocol does not match this branch and it will not work.

### Contributors / eager users: from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Einsia/agent-git
cd agent-git
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` checks the toolchain (rustc, a C compiler), builds, and installs
the binary to `~/.local/bin/agit`. Common flags:

```sh
./setup.sh --debug      # no LTO, much faster while hacking
./setup.sh --test       # run cargo test --lib before installing
./setup.sh --help
```

To build a binary whose built-in hub is the staging deployment, set the build-time default
explicitly. Runtime `AGIT_HUB_URL` and `agit config hub.url ...` still take precedence:

```sh
AGIT_DEFAULT_HUB_URL=https://staging.agent-git.com cargo build --release --locked
```

Internal GitLab pipelines package commit-addressed `dev` and `staging` builds with this setting
embedded. Their `agit --version` output includes the channel and source commit, and `agit upgrade`
is disabled for them so an acceptance-test binary cannot silently turn into the public release.
Only an existing GitHub `agit-v*` tag produces the `prod` channel. The tag push runs the Release
workflow automatically; operators may also select the same reviewed tag through the workflow's
manual production input to retry a failed release without creating a different artifact identity.

Requires **rustc >= 1.88** and a C compiler (`rusqlite` uses the `bundled`
feature, so sqlite's C sources are compiled during the build). The reason for
the toolchain floor is in [`docs/01_setup.md`](docs/01_setup.md).

Both paths install the same binary. npm is for "users who don't want to touch
Rust"; `setup.sh` is for "people changing the code" and "people running
unreleased versions".

The server (**AgentGit**) is a separate repository, deployed on its own.

## Release

`Cargo.toml` is the single source of the version; every npm manifest must
agree with it (`node scripts/check-version.js` — run in CI and before
`npm pack`). To move the version, change every spot in one shot:

```sh
node scripts/bump-version.mjs 0.1.0    # Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock + all npm manifests
```

Release notes live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), and they come first: write the
version's `## [x.y.z]` section, then bump. `bump-version.mjs` refuses to touch a file for
a version that has no section, and `check-version.js` refuses one in CI and before `npm pack`.
The section becomes the GitHub Release body (`scripts/release-notes.mjs` extracts it in
`release.yml`, with repository-relative links pinned to the release tag) and ships inside
the `@einsia/agent-git` package.

After the source release commit passes CI, merge it into GitLab `main`. Wait for
that pipeline's development builds and `mirror:github`, then run its manual
`release:github-tag` job. CI verifies the recorded source-to-mirror mapping and
creates `agit-v<version>` on the public mirror commit. Release tags are immutable;
a stale pipeline cannot publish after either `main` moves.

The mirror rewrites commit IDs, so the source SHA is not the release SHA. Do not
push release tags directly to GitHub. The CI-created tag starts the GitHub Release
workflow, which builds the binaries and then triggers npm publication.

Distribution to users runs through the npm registry: each target ships as a
platform sub-package (`@einsia/agent-git-linux-x64` and friends, gated by
`os`/`cpu` — npm installs only the matching one), and the main
`@einsia/agent-git` pulls them in via `optionalDependencies`. The GitHub
Release holds the canonical tarballs plus `SHA256SUMS`
([contract](.github/RELEASE_ARTIFACTS.md)).

Publishing to npm is the **npm publish** workflow. It runs automatically
once the Release workflow finishes green (and can be dispatched manually —
Actions → npm publish — for retries, `next` dist-tag trials, or a `dry_run`).
It publishes the whole family in dependency order — platform packages →
`@einsia/agent-git` → `create-agit` — with a real global install of the main
tarball as a preflight in between, authenticating via npm trusted publishing
(OIDC, no stored token). The equivalent local fallback:

```sh
gh release download agit-v0.1.0 -p 'agit-*.tar.gz' -D /tmp/agit-dist
node npm/publish.mjs /tmp/agit-dist        # platform packages → main → create-agit
```

`npm/create-agit/` is the one-shot installer behind `npx -y create-agit` — it
depends on the main package and turns the npx cache copy into a durable
`~/.local/bin/agit`, then wires skills/hooks/MCP via `agit setup`. There is
deliberately no unscoped alias package: `agit` on npm belongs to an unrelated
project, and npm's typosquat rule blocks `agent-git` for being one punctuation
mark away from a third party's `agentgit`.

The version oracle (`GET /api/cli/version` on the hub) and `agit upgrade`
both read the npm registry; integrity verification uses the registry's
SRI (sha512). Self-hosted hubs that pin an internal fork set
`AGIT_BACKEND_CLI_REPO` and the whole chain reverts to the GitHub path.

`@einsia/agent-git` is a fresh package name with no existing users, so the
first release goes straight to `latest` — no need to hide in `next` first.
(The old `@einsia/agentgit` stays put; it points at the pre-rewrite CLI.)
