# Using agit

A guide for users, organized by **what you want to do** rather than as a command table. Every
section can be typed as written.

Written against `agit 0.9.0` (`agit --version` tells you which one you have). The full flag list
is in `agit <command> --help`; this document covers only the part you reach for most.

## 1. The mental model first

```
agent   = a git repo       lives in ~/.agit/repos/<owner>/<name>
branch  = one session      once a session occupies a branch, that branch never changes hands
commit  = one user turn    you ask, the agent finishes answering: that is one commit
main    = the file line    AGENTS.md, memory/, skills/ — what sessions share
```

This is not a metaphor; underneath it is a real git repo. `agit log` is the history from the
session's point of view, `agit repo path` prints the repo path, and `git log` inside it shows the
same commits.

Two words recur below:

- **settle**: cut "the conversation added since the last record" into turn commits. The command is
  `agit commit`.
- **VIEW**: the context the agent really sees on the next resume. It is derived — when
  `agit revert` takes something out of it, the original record (the log) does not move a byte.

### Select a repository and ref

Use a full target such as `alice/payments@work`, or set
`AGIT_SESSION=alice/payments@work` before using a local ref such as `work` or `main`.
A workspace binding does not select an existing session for these commands.

For an ordinary explicit ref, a missing local branch can resolve to a single matching
remote-tracking branch. Several remotes carrying that name are ambiguous; a local branch
keeps its identity even when its remote counterpart has advanced. A same-named tag or
another matching object can still make an ordinary explicit ref ambiguous.

`@` selects the exact local session branch in `AGIT_SESSION`. If that local branch is missing,
it refuses instead of selecting a tag, remote-tracking ref, or checkout HEAD. Historical
selectors such as `@#2` are applied after capturing that local branch's tip.

Human command results begin with the verified target and how it was selected:

```text
target: alice/payments@work (via AGIT_SESSION)
```

Fully qualified arguments report `explicit arguments`; a local ref whose repository comes
from the environment reports `explicit arguments + AGIT_SESSION`. An explicit picker choice
reports `interactive selection`. Changing directories with `-C` does not select a session.
An unresolved target never receives a notice. Startup diagnostics and
acquisition progress can appear on stderr before the result.

| Output | Target notice |
| --- | --- |
| `commit`, ordinary `log`/`show`/`view`, tag creation, `fork`/`run`/`resume`, memory status/sync | Verified session, branch, native session identity, or immutable history point |
| Branch and tag lists, `log --branches`/`--graph`, selected-repository fetch, repository-wide pull, `scan` | Repository scope; scan covers the repository publish surface even when refs were supplied |
| Branch/tag mutations, selected-branch push/pull | Actual selected refs; push labels the local source refs |
| `diff`, `merge`, `cherry-pick`, `revert` | Labeled endpoints or target and sources on the same line; transaction sources are identified as recorded state |
| `memory distill`, `distill` | Validated source branch and `main` destination |
| File export, PR creation | Validated source; exported bytes and the remote request remain separate from the human result |

JSON envelopes, quiet mode, active full-screen interfaces, hooks and MCP do not receive a new
human target notice. The existing byte outputs of `show --raw`, `show ref:path`, `show ref#n.k`,
stdout export, `diff --files`, working-state `diff`, `memory diff`, and `repo path` stay unchanged.
Global listings, status, search, `fetch --all`, repository administration, and creation/adoption
commands have their own scope or identity reports rather than an implicit session notice.
For merge transaction controls, `recorded-from` describes the source stored in that transaction;
`commit:<sha>` means its repository namespace was not recorded and is not inferred.

## 2. Getting started

### 2.1 Install

```sh
npm install -g @einsia/agent-git     # prebuilt binary, no Rust toolchain required
agit --version
```

People changing the code install from source:
`git clone https://github.com/Einsia/agent-git && cd agent-git && ./setup.sh`. Both paths install
the same binary.

You also need **git >= 2.28** (repo init uses `git init --initial-branch`). The rest of the
details (musl static linking on Linux, environment variables, platform sub-packages) are in
[`01_setup.md`](01_setup.md) and [`../npm/README.md`](../npm/README.md).

> Do not install `@einsia/agentgit` (no hyphen) — that is the pre-rewrite CLI; its protocol does
> not match.

### 2.2 Sign in

```sh
agit login
```

On a TTY it asks whether to authorize in the browser or use a device code. Where there is no TTY
but someone is watching the output — a container, say — `agit login --device` skips the menu and
goes straight to the device code (it prints a short code you confirm on another device). Fully
unattended CI and agent subprocesses have one path:

```sh
agit login --with-token < token.txt
```

Signing in is not only for push. **Settlement needs an account name**: the commit author and the
`<owner>/` of the repo path both come from the credentials, and neither can be filled in
afterwards. Without a sign-in, `agit commit` refuses outright.

To mark a session offline first, use the `--link-only` of 3.1 below.

### 2.3 Wire up the runtimes (once; after that, forget it)

```sh
agit setup
```

It configures the following integrations. Repeating setup updates existing managed entries:

| What        | Where                                              | Effect                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hooks       | `~/.claude/settings.json`, `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` | SessionStart registers the session, Stop settles a turn automatically |
| skill       | `~/.claude/skills/agit/`, `$CODEX_HOME/skills/agit/`, and so on | teaches the agent the `agit commit --milestone` discipline |
| MCP         | each runtime's MCP config                          | the agent can `search` / `show` other people's sessions directly |
| AGENTS.md   | the current project                                | the project-level rules block                                |

Name the one runtime you use, so no config is written for tools you do not have:

```sh
agit setup --runtime claude-code
agit setup --runtime codex --hooks
cd ~/Projects/payments && agit setup --agents-md     # install just the project-level block
```

With hooks installed, Claude Code and a hook-capable Codex **settle once every time a turn
completes**, and day to day you never type `agit commit`. Manual settlement stays useful — see the
milestones in 3.2.

Codex hook installation is capability-gated by `codex features list`; unsupported installations
are left untouched. Codex treats user hooks as untrusted until they are reviewed, so it may ask for
approval before first use or after the installed command changes. OpenCode and Cursor have no
equivalent "turn finished" callback; the skill above injects the settlement discipline into the
agent, and the agent types `agit commit` itself at the right moment.

`agit setup --agents-md` refreshes the managed section and normalizes nested AgentGit markers,
preserving the text around that section. An unchanged repeat does not append another marker pair.

### 2.4 Create an agent repo inside a project

```sh
cd ~/Projects/payments
agit init payments
```

At a terminal, bare `agit init` opens the same operation as a full-screen wizard: type the repo
name, choose whether to bind this directory, and optionally review seed assets. Seed choices start
empty and the screen closes before the existing init path writes anything. Explicit arguments,
pipes, CI and agent sessions keep the command-line behavior.

```
✓ repo created: alice/payments (main is the file line; scaffolding in ~/.agit/repos/alice/payments)
  bound to this directory. Next:
    agit import          adopt a running session (settles on import)
    agit new -b <name>   start a fresh session (inherits memory/skills)
```

`--seed` finds the AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / `.claude/skills/` already in the project and collects
them into main **after asking you item by item**. With no TTY it collects nothing (personal memory
can hold private material, and it is never collected silently); `-y` takes everything.

**`agit init` writes no file into your code repo.** The binding between the directory and the
agent is recorded under `~/.agit/workspaces/`. (The only things that touch project files are the
AGENTS.md block from `agit setup`, and the `agit commit --code` you ask for explicitly in 3.2.)

## 3. The everyday path

A fictional project `payments` ties the rest together. The output fragments are real runs.

### 3.1 Put a running session under version control

The most common starting point: you have done a stretch of work in Claude Code and want that
conversation to have a history.

```sh
cd ~/Projects/payments
agit import                       # no argument: lists the unadopted sessions in this directory
```

At a terminal, the zero-argument form opens a full-screen candidate list. Pick a session, choose
the destination repo with `Tab`, type a new branch, or press `l` for the offline `--link-only`
path. The screen closes before lineage selection or the ordinary import command writes anything.
Pipes, CI and agent sessions list explicit choices and leave local state unchanged.

With a full native ID, runtime and destination, inspect and choose the lineage:

```sh
agit import 7f3a1c2e-1111-4a4a-8b8b-000000000001 --from claude-code --into alice/payments@ratelimit
```

The terminal offers verified local prefix candidates, an independent import, and cancellation.
A single candidate still requires a choice. Noninteractive calls return the choices and exit
without adopting; `--onto <ref>` selects a base and `--independent` explicitly starts a separate
line. `--propose-lineage` prints the same local evidence without applying a choice. Semantic
comparison is unavailable, so a missing verified prefix does not prove unrelated history.

After accepting an independent import, the session's turns are recorded:

```
✓ adopted claude-code 7f3a1c2e-111
working dir  unknown (filled in when a version is recorded)
link         ~/.agit/store/claude-code/7f3a1c2e-1111-4a4a-8b8b-000000000001.json

#1 a37029959 add a per-user_id rate limit to payments
#2 21d8a51ff add a test for it

✓ settled 2 turns → alice/payments @ ratelimit
```

Select that branch explicitly for subsequent commands in this terminal:

```sh
export AGIT_SESSION=alice/payments@ratelimit
```

`agit import` cannot change its parent shell's environment. Keep this selection while following
the commands below, or supply `alice/payments@ratelimit` directly to each session command.

Adopting and recording the first version are **one command** — the in-between state ("linked, but
unversioned") means nothing to anyone.

A fresh claim needs an explicit destination repo and session branch. Use
`--into alice/payments@ratelimit`, or `--repo alice/payments -b ratelimit`.
The compatibility `-n <agent>` form names a repo for an explicit independent/base import and
still needs `-b <branch>`; read-only lineage discovery requires the qualified destination.
Session turns cannot land on `main`, which is the file line. Use `--from codex` or
`--from claude-code` to name the source runtime; the option is named `--from`, not `--runtime`.

import **does not copy** the transcript; it writes a link. The original session keeps growing and
the link keeps pointing at it.

**Offline** (on a plane, not signed in yet):

```sh
agit import 7f3a1c2e --link-only    # mark it only, record no version
# back online: choose lineage before recording the first version
agit import 7f3a1c2e-1111-4a4a-8b8b-000000000001 --from claude-code --into alice/payments@ratelimit
```

The offline link has no repository owner or branch claim. The explicit import target establishes
that identity before recording; `agit commit` cannot infer it from the account you sign in to.

**To show it to outsiders**, redact first: `--privacy` adopts a washed copy (secrets become
`[redacted:<rule>]`; home directory, user name and host name become stable pseudonyms), and not
one byte of the original enters history. claude-code only; other runtimes use
`agit export --redact`.

The copy is **frozen** and carries its own new session id: the original session keeps growing, the
copy does not follow. To publish later conversation, run
`agit import <id> --privacy --into alice/payments@<new-branch> --independent` again — every run is a new frozen copy, and the old
branch, already taken by the old copy, is never refreshed.

### 3.2 Settle: get new conversation into history

With hooks installed this step is automatic. Three occasions call for typing it by hand.

**a. Land it every so often**

```sh
agit commit
```

```
target: alice/payments@ratelimit (via AGIT_SESSION)
#3 6b2bb67d8 make the rate-limit threshold configurable

✓ settled 1 turns → alice/payments @ ratelimit
  next: agit push to publish · agit log to read history
```

One turn is one commit, and the message is that turn's user prompt (squashed to one line,
truncated when too long). A trailing turn that has not ended stays for next time — the question is
there but the agent has not answered, or a tool call the agent made has not returned yet (when the
agent runs `agit commit` from inside a turn, that call is the open one). It says so:
`the current turn is still in flight`. The turn lands on the next `agit commit` after the turn
ends (the Stop hook does this), and another `agit push` is what puts it on the Hub. With nothing
new it prints `nothing new since ...` and exits normally; that is not an error.

**b. A phase is done: mark a milestone**

```sh
agit commit --milestone "rate limiting done, tests pass" --tag ms-ratelimit --code
```

- `--milestone` writes a one-line phase summary into the last turn commit; `agit log` shows it
  as ★.
- `--tag` tags it while you are there.
- `--code` also commits in the **code repo** (it really commits only when there are uncommitted
  changes; on a clean tree it records the current HEAD as the anchor) and writes the `origin@sha`
  cross anchor into this turn. The code repo must already have an `origin` remote; when cwd is not
  a Git repo, `--code` warns and skips the code-side commit, and the session turn still settles
  normally.

This one is for "whoever reads the log later and wants to know how far it got". Automatic
settlement does not write it for you.

One precondition: all three flags **attach only to the new turns this settlement produces**. With
no new turn pending, the whole command is a no-op (it prints `nothing new since ...`, exits
normally, and lands neither the ★ nor the tag nor the anchor). So with hooks installed, have the
agent type this inside the session — while the Stop hook has not settled that turn yet; typing it
in the terminal afterwards cannot catch up.

**c. Only shared files changed**

```sh
cd $(agit repo path)          # into the agent repo's main checkout (the main file line): edit memory/ skills/ AGENTS.md directly
                              # a session branch's copy lives in its own worktree: agit repo path <owner/repo>@<branch>
cd -                          # back to the project directory to settle: context resolves against the project directory, never inside the agent repo
agit commit -m "memory: conclusions on the refund path"
```

`-m` is a file-only commit, legal only when **no new conversation is pending settlement**. With
new turns it refuses; run `agit commit` first.

### 3.3 Look back

```sh
agit log
```

**Typed in front of a terminal, this opens the full-screen interface**, not the text below: a
timeline ordered by turn, `Tab` switches to the branch view, Enter reads that turn's conversation.
In a pipe, in CI and inside an agent session it stays text; to get text in a terminal too, add
`--no-tui`. The tests and the other screens are in [`docs/07_tui.md`](07_tui.md).

Here is the text form:

```
#  1 acdd8307e [file ] agit: init (main file line)
#  2 82eb408cb [file ] agit: claim session line ratelimit
#  1 a37029959 [turn ] add a per-user_id rate limit to payments
#  2 21d8a51ff [turn ] add a test for it
#  3 6b2bb67d8 [turn ] make the rate-limit threshold configurable
#  4 2f5f1a3a6 [turn ] make the error code configurable too  ⌂ ms-ratelimit
      code https://github.com/alice/payments.git@3d0fac3
      ★ rate limiting done, tests pass
```

That last turn is what the settlement in 3.2b produced: `⌂` is the tag, `★` is the milestone, and
`code` is the code anchor `--code` recorded.

Common combinations:

```sh
agit log --oneline -n 50            # one line per turn
agit log --kind turn                # conversation only, without file commits like repo creation and claims
agit log --grep rate --since 7d     # message substring + time
agit log --graph                    # the structure when there are several branches
agit log -- memory/notes.md         # only commits that touched this shared file
```

**Read the conversation itself**:

```sh
agit show                                   # the branch explicitly selected by AGIT_SESSION
agit show 7f3a                              # by session id prefix — this one is exact
agit show alice/payments@ratelimit          # the VIEW of one branch of one repo (the world resume sees)
agit show 'ratelimit#5.1'                   # the 1st event the 5th commit added, raw JSON
agit show 'ratelimit:AGENTS.md'             # a shared file's contents at that point
agit show --agent alice/payments --tui      # full-screen browsing
```

Mind the quotes: `#` starts a comment in the shell, so always quote a reference carrying a `#`.

**Compare two points**:

```sh
agit diff main..ratelimit                   # fork point + which turns each side added (the default)
agit diff --view 'ratelimit#3..ratelimit'   # insertions / deletions in the VIEW sequence
agit diff --files v0.1..ratelimit           # text diff of the shared files
agit diff                                   # no range: what is still unsettled in the workspace
```

With unrelated Git histories, `diff --turns` and merge reconnaissance also report a
**semantic prefix** and each side's remaining normalized LOG turns. This comparison
uses the full saved LOG even when VIEW has been compacted or edited. Its turn ordinals
are content positions, not `#n` commit selectors. A semantic hash is never a Git merge
base, and it does not change merge parents or the endpoints used by `--view` and `--files`.

Semantic comparison uses the shared runtime IR: it excludes timestamps, runtime identity,
path metadata, tool results, compaction and unmodeled content. Tool details depend on what
the native adapter represents. Matching hashes therefore do not establish complete
transcript equality. An endpoint without comparable user turns is reported as unavailable.

**See what the VIEW is made of** (the scouting command before a merge):

```sh
agit view ratelimit
```

```
  VIEW @ ratelimit (8 events)
     0    log#0 user           488B this branch            add a per-user_id rate limit to payments
     1    log#1 assistant      466B this branch
     ...
```

### 3.4 Continue yesterday's session

```sh
agit resume ratelimit
```

When the native session is still on this machine it is zero-copy (`claude --resume <id>`
directly); otherwise a new one is materialized from the VIEW and launched.

```sh
agit resume ratelimit --no-launch      # print the launch command only, paste it yourself
agit resume ratelimit --as codex       # switch runtime (it shows you the lossy list first)
agit resume ratelimit --cwd ../payments-2
```

Preparing the same branch tip for the same runtime and directory is idempotent: agit prints the
existing runtime session command again. If the branch advances, agit replaces a prepared instance
only when its baseline proves that the runtime transcript is untouched. Unsettled content blocks
replacement and must be committed or continued on a fork.

The zero-copy path reuses the runtime's native transcript and bypasses the VIEW. So what
`agit revert` (see 4.3) just took out of the VIEW is **still visible** in a session resumed
zero-copy on this machine. For a revert to take effect in the resumed session, the materialized
path has to run — another machine, a merge, `--as` and `--cwd` all trigger it.

Every turn settlement also records a summary of the Git state of the cwd at that moment. On
resume, when the current cwd's origin, HEAD, branch or worktree summary has changed, resume lists
both states first and lets you continue, inject the difference into the runtime as
system/developer instructions, or cancel. When the current cwd is not a Git repo it only says the
comparison is impossible and continues; it never blocks the resume.

`resume` is a **strict entry point**: it takes a branch only. Tags, historical commits and `#n`
are all refused; those go through `fork` (next section). The reason is that history is not
rewritten — to get back to an old state, grow a new line instead of bending the old one back.

Start a session from scratch (no old context, only the team memory):

```sh
agit new alice/payments -b onboarding   # inherits AGENTS.md / memory/ / skills/ from main
```

Name the destination repo explicitly when starting a session. An omitted repo requires
`AGIT_SESSION`; a workspace binding or adopted transcript does not supply a session target.

### 3.5 Off track: back to one turn and start over

```sh
agit log                               # find that point's short sha or tag first
agit fork 21d8a51 -b ratelimit-retry --resume
```

```
✓ forked 21d8a51 into ratelimit-retry (alice/payments @ e45a9f2e8 — new session in place)
```

fork is the only form of "checking out an old state" in agit. The source can be a branch head, a
historical commit, a tag, `<ref>#n`, someone else's `owner/repo@ref`, even a sealed branch. The
old line stays exactly as it was.

`--resume` means "launch it right after the fork"; without it you only get the branch and
`agit resume` it yourself later.

### 3.6 Publish and pick up

**Publish**:

```sh
agit push --dry-run     # rehearsal: runs the secret scan, lists what would be sent, no network
agit push
```

```
dry run — nothing left this machine
repo        alice/payments
branches    ratelimit, main
versions    1
remote      none yet (a real push would create it)
visibility  asked at first publish; unchanged after that
```

Three things worth knowing:

- **Visibility is decided at the first push only.** On a TTY it asks; non-interactive defaults to
  private. Change it afterwards with `agit repo visibility alice/payments public`; `agit push`
  never touches it.
- **Publishing is selective.** By default only the current session branch is pushed, `-b` can be
  repeated, and `--all` is what pushes everything. The main file line comes along — that is where
  the `ratelimit, main` in the fragment above comes from.
- **There is no `--force`.** History only grows.

**Pick up someone else's**:

```sh
agit clone einsia/payments                  # fetch only, nothing is launched; origin points at the source
agit show einsia/payments@refund-fix        # look at one of its session branches first
agit run einsia/payments@refund-fix -b my-take   # to actually run it: forks a branch you can write to and launches it
```

Both of those must point at a **session branch**. `@main` is the file line and carries no session,
so `show` and `run` both refuse it (to start a new session on its team memory, use `agit new`).
When you do not know the branches, run `agit log einsia/payments` first.

`clone` is **read-only by default**: nothing is created in your name, and local `agit commit` works
as usual. When you decide to take over:

```sh
agit clone einsia/payments --mine      # copies it under your name on the hub, repoints origin at yours, remembers the source as upstream
```

`agit run` is "one command to run any frozen ref": fetch → arbitrate (fork if needed) →
materialize → launch. The one-line reproduction command you hand people in a README usually looks
like this:

```sh
agit run lab/repro@v1 -b repro-1
```

**Sync between two machines**:

```sh
agit pull        # fast-forward only. On a real divergence it offers merge / fork and decides nothing on its own
agit fetch       # objects and remote refs only — local branches never move
```

### 3.7 Memory: the local directory, the session branch, main

Memory has three homes; the first two sync automatically, and the third moves only when you decide
it does:

```text
the runtime's own memory dir   Claude Code: ~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/   ← live copy, agit does not take it over
the session branch's memory/   this session's versioned snapshot                   ← collected at every agit commit
main's memory/                 shared by the team, inherited by agit new           ← moves only through agit distill / merge
```

`new` / `resume` merge the branch's memory into the runtime directory before launching: into
per-branch subdirectories `agit/<owner>/<name>/<branch>/`, with a marked index block in
`MEMORY.md` pointing at them. A top-level local file with the same name and the same content is
not placed again, and no file of your own is touched. `resume` the same branch on another machine
and Claude reads that memory immediately. Both sides look only at first-level `*.md` (the shape of
Claude memory); subdirectories and other extensions do not enter the branch.

Every `agit commit` (the Stop hook's automatic settlement included) collects the changes
**relative to the baseline taken at launch** into the session branch, as one file commit: what was
newly written, modified or deleted at the top level, plus the agent's edits and deletions inside
the mirrored subdirectories. Personal memory that was already there at launch and was not touched
this time does not enter the branch. A file the secret scan hits (including values registered
with `agit secrets`) is not collected, and is named. A session not launched through agit has no
baseline: settlement establishes the baseline and collects nothing, and an explicit
`agit memory sync` is what pulls in everything currently at the top level.
`agit config memory.track off` turns local collection off.

`main` does not move on its own — it gets pushed and inherited by a colleague's `agit new`, while
the runtime's memory directory naturally holds personal feedback and private material. When a
phase is done:

```sh
agit memory status          # one line per file: branch vs main, local vs branch
agit memory diff notes.md
agit distill                # files that differ from main enter main after item-by-item confirmation (each passes the secret scan first)
agit push -b main
```

A file deleted on the branch that main had passed down is carried into main as a deletion by
distillation too. `commit --milestone` and `push` report how many items are not distilled yet.
`agit memory sync` does one bidirectional sync right away. Only Claude Code has a per-project
memory directory on disk; on other runtimes `sync` is a no-op, while `status` / `distill` work on
the branch as usual.

## 4. Several people, several lines

### 4.1 Share with someone who does not have agit

```sh
agit share owner/repo@branch --expire 24h --views 3
agit share owner/repo@branch --full-log
agit share 7f3a --expire 24h --views 3
```

Saved refs share their VIEW; `--full-log` selects the saved LOG, including discarded history.
An explicit native session ID shares its live transcript and is labelled accordingly. Omitting
the target requires `AGIT_SESSION` and selects that exact branch's saved VIEW. Invalid or
missing VIEW content is refused without widening the share.

Mints a read-only sharing link; the other side needs no account. **End-to-end encrypted by
default**, with the key in the URL's `#k=` fragment, printed once at that moment and never again —
so send the whole link; `agit share list` cannot give the key back.

```sh
agit share list           # which links are still alive
agit share rm <slug>      # revoke one
```

`--public` is an unencrypted, crawlable link; `--password` adds a passphrase. A session with a
secret finding is refused outright.

### 4.2 Search for precedent

```sh
agit search "monorepo build cache" -n 5
```

Searches the corpus you can read for "has anyone done this before". Every hit carries an outcome
(success / failed / unknown) — a failed one is a warning about the pitfall, not a recipe.

The main entry point is MCP: after `agit setup` the agent calls `search` itself and looks for
precedent whenever it is stuck.

### 4.3 Merge two sessions

You forked off the main line to try something, the conclusion is worth bringing back, but the
process must not pollute the main line's context:

```sh
agit merge try-ratelimit --dry-run      # the fork point and how much each side added, first
agit merge try-ratelimit -m "the conclusion only, not the process"
```

The second opens a transaction, locks the target branch, and then **launches a merge agent** to do
the reconciliation. Text conflicts are not the point; **intent conflicts** are (one side buckets by
`user_id`, the other renames it to `uid`; both compile, and together they are wrong).

The merge agent runs the whole process on its own side — picking material, reconciling shared
files, writing the conclusion, landing it — and you only read the result. To learn where it got
to, or to call it off:

```sh
agit merge --status      # while the transaction is open and unlanded, where it is stuck
agit merge --abort       # give up; the target branch never moved
```

That `-m` sentence goes to the merge agent as the opening prompt and bounds the reconciliation
("the conclusion only", "keep the reproduction steps", and so on). Without a summary nothing
lands; agit enforces that and the agent cannot get around it.

**To pick a few turns only**, not worth a transaction:

```sh
agit cherry-pick try-ratelimit#3..#4 -m "take the uid rename over"
```

**Take a bad conclusion out of the context**:

```sh
agit revert @#12.4 -m "the conclusion is wrong"
```

It removes from the VIEW only; not a line of evidence leaves the log. This is the one correct way
to undo — no rebase, no amend, no force push.

### 4.4 PR

Propose a change to someone else's agent:

```sh
agit clone einsia/payments --mine                        # a pushable copy under your own name first
# do the work, agit commit
agit push -b my-branch
agit pr create einsia/payments@refund-fix -b my-branch -m "what it does"
```

`-b` is the source branch in your fork; the positional argument is their destination
(`<owner/repo>[@<branch>]`). The author's `agit pr merge` **does not launch a merge agent** — it
only lands what you proposed, so when the two sides have really diverged, reconcile it in your own
fork (4.3) before proposing.

On the author's side:

```sh
agit pr list alice/payments      # owner/repo must be written out here
agit pr show 12
agit pr fetch 12                 # lands at local refs/agit-pr/12
agit pr merge 12
```

## 5. Scan for secrets before publishing

```sh
agit scan
```

```
✓ clean scan (1 refs)
```

`agit push` runs the same scan internally; `agit scan` runs it separately, up front (CI uses it
too). The exit code is 7 when it finds something.

- **False positive**: add that string to `$AGIT_HOME/.agit-allow-secrets`, or put an
  `agit:allow-secret` note on that line of the original.
- **A real secret**: inspect the reported carrier before publishing. `agit revert @#n.k`
  removes context from the VIEW; it preserves the LOG and Git history that publishing carries.

`--sensitive` reviews selected committed VIEW events for suspected disclosure risks:

```sh
agit config runtime.default claude-code
agit scan alice/payments@session-1 --sensitive
```

The review adapter supports installed Claude Code versions with the required isolation controls.
The configured provider may be remote, and the native runtime's authentication housekeeping may
perform its own I/O. Unsettled turns and working files are outside this selected VIEW review.
Reports are advisory: AgentGit never applies model-supplied remedies automatically.

A completed review returns exit 0 without findings or exit 7 with findings. Failure to run or
complete the model review returns exit 4. The deterministic secret scan remains the publishing
gate. See the [scan command manual](../src/commands/subskills/scan.md) for runtime requirements,
scope selection, review limits, and report fields.

To review the complete outgoing publication interactively, use:

```sh
agit push alice/payments@session-1 --audit
```

This opens the reviewer in the current terminal, where it shows progress and asks
questions. Its workflow reads full historical LOG through immutable `agit show`
targets and reviews the remaining published text, including shared-file history
and readable LFS payloads. After it finishes, push validates the report and asks
separately before publishing. Ordinary push does not launch a model. An incomplete
or interrupted audit stops this push; `--audit --dry-run` reviews without publishing.
See the [push command manual](../src/commands/subskills/push.md) for runtime, terminal,
and report requirements.

## 6. Detach a session from the terminal (remote control)

Closing the laptop must not stop the session.

```sh
agit login
agit rc start --detach --name my-laptop
agit rc status
```

The daemon connects to the hub over outbound WSS; no inbound port is opened. Then **Bind a
folder** in the web interface: at the moment of binding, the private agent repo for that folder is
created. Every message sent from the web interface still goes through the same hooks settlement
path, lands as a turn commit, and shows up in `agit log`.

```sh
agit rc list             # every machine under your name (offline ones included)
agit rc revoke <id>      # revoke one: disconnects immediately, frees the slot
agit rc stop
```

The quota is 5 machines per person; an offline machine still holds its slot, and only a revoke
frees it. The full design is in [`04_workspaces.md`](04_workspaces.md).

## 7. When something goes wrong

```sh
agit doctor
```

```
  [✓] runtime claude-code resumable · format claude-code · /Users/alice/.local/bin/claude
  [✓] git              git version 2.47.1
  [✓] local store      1 adopted sessions, 1 versioned
  [!] agent repos      1 of them, 1 with unpublished commits: payments
  [✓] sign-in          alice @ https://agent-git.com

=== session metadata integrity ===
  ✓ all 1 repos’ session metadata is consistent
  ✓ checked 1 live transcripts: all continue committed content
  ✓ the VIEW of 1 repos all reference reachable events
```

An offline check-up: whether the runtimes are on PATH, the git version, the store against the
remote, whether the VIEW is self-consistent, whether live transcripts are still being appended to.
Add `--check-backend` when you suspect the network.

```sh
agit upgrade --check      # report whether a new release exists, nothing else
agit upgrade              # atomically replaces the current binary; on failure the installed one is untouched
```

## 8. Quick reference

### 8.1 Reference syntax

```
owner/repo              a repo on the hub (the repo name alone when it is unique locally)
owner/repo@<ref>        a ref in someone else's / a remote repo
<branch> <tag> <sha>    a ref inside the current repo (sha prefix ≥ 4; an ambiguous match is reported, never resolved for you)
@                       the current session's branch (resolved through AGIT_SESSION, valid only inside a session)
<ref>~n                 n commits back
<ref>#n                 the commit the n-th turn settled (#-1 is the last turn)
<ref>#n.k               the k-th event in the n-th turn
<ref>#a..#b             a turn range
<ref>:<path>            the file contents at that point
```

Two easy traps:

1. **The n in `#n` is the turn ordinal in the left column of `agit log`**. Repo creation, claims,
   a fork's identity commit, a `-m` file commit and merge commits take no turn ordinal and leave
   that column blank in the log; point at them with a short sha, a tag or `<ref>~n`. Only when the
   whole history never declared a turn ordinal (an ordinary git branch pushed in from outside)
   does `#n` fall back to "the n-th commit from the root".
2. The shell treats a leading `#` as a comment. Always quote a reference containing `#`:
   `agit show 'ratelimit#5.1'`.

### 8.2 "What is the current branch"

Ordinary commands take their target from explicit arguments or `AGIT_SESSION`. `agit status`
reports the supplied identity and discovered sessions; discovery never chooses a branch.

```text
1. Explicit positional arguments or --repo
2. AGIT_SESSION=<owner>/<repo>@<branch>
3. Otherwise require an explicit target
```

`@` requires `AGIT_SESSION`. Native runtime IDs only help reject a stale supplied identity;
workspace bindings, checkout state and the newest session cannot select the target. Interactive
import and resume pickers accept an explicit user choice.

```sh
agit log alice/payments@ratelimit
export AGIT_SESSION=alice/payments@ratelimit
agit log @
agit branch --repo alice/payments
```

### 8.3 Command overview

| Goal                   | Command                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sign in / identity     | `login` `logout` `whoami` `config`                        |
| Create / fetch repos   | `init` `clone` `repo` (create/list/info/visibility/collab/invite/rename/delete/path) |
| Adopt / status         | `import` `status` `switch` `branch` (rename/rm/seal)      |
| Record                 | `commit` `tag` `memory` (status/diff/distill/sync) `distill` |
| Inspect                | `log` `show` `diff` `view`                                |
| New line / continue    | `fork` `new` `resume` `run`                               |
| Merge / undo           | `merge` (pick/drop/summary) `cherry-pick` `revert`        |
| Remote                 | `push` `pull` `fetch`                                     |
| Discover / share       | `search` `share` (list/rm) `pr` (create/list/show/fetch/merge) |
| Export / diagnostics   | `export` `scan` `setup` `upgrade` `doctor`                |
| Remote control         | `rc` (start/stop/status/list/pair/revoke)                 |

Global options: `--no-color` `--json` `-y/--yes` `-q/--quiet` `-C <dir>`.
Only some commands really emit JSON for `--json` today (`view` and `scan` certainly do); do not
rely on it indiscriminately in scripts.

### 8.4 Where things live

```
~/.agit/repos/<owner>/<name>/    agent repos (real git repos)
~/.agit/store/                   session links (pointing at the original in the runtime directory, not a copy)
~/.agit/workspaces/              directory ↔ Agent repo bindings
~/.agit/credentials/<hub>.json   credentials, one file per hub (0600)
~/.agit/config.json              global config
~/.agit/secret-filter/           the encrypted vault of registered secrets (its key is elsewhere)
~/.agit/keystore/                the vault key, only with `secrets.keystore = file` (0600)
```

`AGIT_HOME` moves the whole thing elsewhere (default `~/.agit`). `AGIT_HUB_URL` switches hub, and
**switching hub is switching identity**: credentials are stored per host, so switching back and
forth needs no new sign-in.

Config has six keys, and the same command reads and writes:

```sh
agit config --list
agit config runtime.default codex     # write
agit config runtime.default           # read
```

At a terminal, bare `agit config` opens a full-screen editor for every supported key. It shows
effective and stored values separately, including an active `AGIT_HUB_URL` override. Explicit
keys, values, `--unset`, `--list`, pipes, CI and agent sessions retain the command-line path.

`hub.url` · `runtime.default` · `push.visibility` · `commit.auto` · `memory.track` (`session | off`,
whether the runtime's project memory is collected into the session branch, see 3.7) ·
`secrets.keystore` (`os | file`, where the global registration key lives: the system credential store,
or a private file under `~/.agit/keystore/` for a machine with no desktop session such as an SSH
login or a CI runner — Unix only, and a backup of `~/.agit` then carries the key along with the
global vault; repository dictionaries keep their own local keys beside the mappings in `.git`;
`AGIT_SECRETS_KEYSTORE` overrides it, and `agit doctor` reports whether the chosen store
answers).
`push.visibility` governs the first publish only: push's `--private`/`--public` overrides it, and so
does the preference `agit init --private` records in the repo; set to `ask` (the default) it asks
once at the first publish, and a non-interactive environment gets private.
Automatic settlement is enabled by default: `commit.auto = true`. Setting it to `false` disables
hook and supervisor settlement; explicit `agit commit` remains available. Unsetting the key
restores the enabled default. The config list and editor show this effective default separately
from the stored value.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success, including nothing to do |
| `1` | Generic failure, or an aggregate result containing failed entries |
| `2` | Invalid arguments or request configuration |
| `3` | A reference does not resolve, or a terminal selection is ambiguous |
| `4` | An execution precondition is not met |
| `5` | Authentication is missing or no longer valid |
| `6` | Network or Hub request failure |
| `7` | Policy refusal, including publication and secret gates |
| `8` | Interaction or explicit candidate selection is required |

`1` is a supported generic result when the command cannot establish a more precise cause.
Known failures use their specific category: a failed local store preparation is `4`, an
expired credential is `5`, and a positively identified Hub failure is `6`. Unknown Git stderr
does not establish any of those causes merely by containing similar words.

Batch search uses `1` when at least one query fails and preserves each query's result or
error. Scripts should inspect those entries instead of assuming a single cause for the batch.
Human, quiet, and JSON output preserve the command's category; JSON also includes it in
`exit_code`, with `ok` true only for success. Read the diagnostic and any structured recovery
actions before deciding how to retry a failed operation.
