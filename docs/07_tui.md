# The side people use: the terminal interface

The earlier documents are all about the model: how a session is stored, how
branches split into lines, how a workspace is decoupled. This one is about **how
a person uses it** — what belongs on screen when a command is typed with no
arguments.

agit's main user is an agent: agents settle through hooks, learn who they are
from environment variables, and their output is read by programs. A person
sitting at the terminal needs something else: to **see what is there before
deciding what to do**. `agit resume` wants a branch name first and `agit new`
wants a repo name first — and remembering those two is exactly what opening the
terminal was for.

The interface solves that one thing. It adds no capability and changes no
existing output.

## 1. When it opens

Four tests, all required:

1. the command's **key argument is empty** (each command defines its own key
   argument);
2. stdin **and** stdout are both terminals;
3. **not inside an agent session**;
4. not explicitly turned off
   (`--no-tui` / `AGIT_TUI=0` / `--json` / `-q` / `-y`).

`--tui` overrides test 3, **but not test 4**. `--json` asks for machine-readable
output, `-q` asks for quiet, `-y` asks not to be prompted — none of the three is
compatible with "pop up a full-screen interface". Letting one flag silently
override another only manufactures "why was this run different" questions.

### Why test 3 speaks up and the other two do not

The three ways of not opening are nothing alike:

* **not a tty** (a pipe, CI): nobody is watching that side, and a line of
  explanation only pollutes stderr;
* **turned off by the user**: they just typed `--no-tui`; saying it back is
  noise;
* **inside an agent session**: they typed the bare command expecting a list and
  got a screen of plain text.

The third one has to be said, and it has to say which test blocked it and how to
get around it:

```text
note not opening the TUI: this looks like an agent session
     (AGIT_SESSION=nana/payments@refund-fix). use `agit --tui` to open it anyway.
```

Drop any one of those parts and the user is left guessing. The note goes to
stderr, so stdout is still consumable by a pipe.

### The tests are not a config key

There is no `tui.enabled` key. "When it opens" is a property of **this call** —
whether anyone is watching, who this output goes to — while configuration is
state that persists across calls. Make it configuration and, on one machine, the
behavior inside a pipe and the behavior in a terminal are decided by a file that
has nothing to do with either.

## 2. The handoff: the through-line

The interface does not exist for "a good-looking list"; it exists to **put the
user inside Claude Code's or Codex's own interface**.

Once a session is picked:

```text
agit's interface suspends  →  the terminal goes to the runtime  →  the runtime exits  →  agit takes it back  →  rescan, back to the list
```

**No nested interface.** The agent's TUI wants the same alt screen and the same
raw mode, and agit does not wrap another frame around it — that would wreck both
renderings at once. So terminal state is four actions (take over, suspend,
resume, give back), not two.

### The one invariant: entries and exits balance

The terminal is state that lives **outside the process**. One restore too few
leaves the user with a shell that has no echo and no cursor, and they do not
connect that to agit — they conclude the terminal is broken. One restore too
many is just as harmful: leaving the alt screen again when it has already been
left wipes out what is in their scrollback.

The invariant holds for **any** sequence of actions, including a panic partway
through, an early return, and a child process crashing while suspended. So the
state machine is independent of execution and can be tested exhaustively;
restoration goes through `Drop`, not through "remember to call it at the end of
the function".

### Results stay in the scrollback

Once the interface closes, the terminal shows what just happened, the same as
after an ordinary command. So everything that is read afterwards — which repo
was picked, which branch was created, which files were materialized — prints on
the **normal screen**, not in the alt screen. What is written in the alt screen
is gone the moment it exits, and that stretch turns blank.

`agit new` is therefore "pick the repo full-screen, type the name on the normal
screen": the name is this session's identity in version control, and it and its
result both leave a trace.

## 3. The screens

### 3.1 Bare `agit` / `agit resume` — which one to continue

`resume` continues an existing local session and never creates a fork. To start
from a tag, historical point or another author's source, use `agit run <ref>`;
it continues a writable session head when possible and otherwise creates a new
writable session.

Sources and project badges:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `here` | a session adopted in this directory |
| `same-repo` | a branch in the same code repo |
| `unnamed` | a session that exists in the runtime but is not managed yet |
| `elsewhere` | an adopted session in another project, shown only in all-project scope |

All three sources share one recency axis; on an exact tie an adopted session
comes first. The status bar keeps the number of `unnamed` sessions visible
without letting the badge split the list into a second ordering rule.

Import and resume start with an explicit runtime scope when candidates span multiple
recognized runtimes; a single-runtime list needs no additional step. The scope can
include all available runtimes to preserve the combined recency view. Tab or arrow
keys change this preselection and Enter opens candidates; Esc cancels without adopting.

`a` toggles current-project and all-project candidates. Current scope retains the
same-repo discovery signal for adopted branches. Every row carries its recorded
project directory; missing directories remain `unknown`, never decoded from a slug.
In the resume list, Tab cycles runtime scope. Import's existing stage navigation and
the naming inbox keep their Tab meaning; `r` returns to runtime preselection there.
Scope keys do not intercept filter input or branch-name editing. They change the
visible candidates, never the selected command identity.

Discovery reads runtime indexes and local claims. Missing opening prompts and paths
use a bounded opening window on the leading unmanaged candidates, with a cached
window for a newly highlighted import candidate. Cursor's project is recovered only
when that candidate is highlighted, using the native body/path convention. An
unreadable or incomplete window displays an unavailable preview; it does not open
the rest of a transcript or materialize a runtime export. Enter still delegates to
ordinary import/resume, which revalidates the explicitly selected identity.

Every screen also carries one bounded snapshot of `agit rc status`. The probe
runs before the alternate screen is entered and is refreshed after a runtime
handoff, so a slow control socket cannot freeze an already captured terminal.
The bar says `rc: online` only when the daemon reports a live hub connection;
every other outcome is the conservative `rc: offline`.

Naming is itself an explicit action: the interface does not decide the repo or
branch. When unnamed sessions exist, the naming inbox opens before this list,
both on initial entry and after a runtime hands the terminal back. Enter on an
unnamed row opens the same inbox again.

```text
┌ agit name ── nana @ agent-git.com ── ⚠ 2 unnamed ────────────────────┐

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 ↑↓ session   tab repo   enter name   s skip   x ignore   q quit
```

`Tab` changes the destination repo; branch editing has its own mode so command
keys remain typeable as branch-name characters. Enter adopts through the same
`agit import <id> --from <runtime> --into <owner/repo>@<branch>` path as the
CLI, with its output on the normal screen. `s` skips only this visit and leaves
the session in the inbox for next time. `x` records a persistent dismissal, for
sessions that should never enter version control. The runtime is part of every
identity, so equal ids from two runtime indexes are never conflated.

SessionStart hooks also make the state visible while the runtime owns the
terminal. Claude titles managed sessions `agit <owner/repo>@<branch>` and
unmanaged sessions `agit: unnamed`; both Claude and Codex give the agent the
explicit `agit import` form for an unmanaged session if the user asks to save
the conversation. Codex exposes no SessionStart title field, so its managed
sessions need no response. Compacting an existing conversation does not reapply
the Claude title, because that would replace a later name chosen by the user.

`●` / `○` is "the transcript file has grown within the last 90 seconds". A live
session must not be taken over by a second writer — once two streams of appends
interleave, both histories are destroyed (see
[`04_workspaces.md`](04_workspaces.md) §4). That is data corruption, not an
experience problem, so enter on a live session is blocked and says which
terminal to exit first.

With no candidate at all it **does not open an empty shell**: making the user
press q at an empty list wastes an interaction.

### 3.2 `agit new` — pick a repo, type a name

Local repositories appear first. When signed in, the picker then loads repositories
owned by the current Hub account without delaying the first frame. Hub-only rows
show `Hub · clone on selection`; an exact `owner/repo` already present locally
keeps its local metadata and validation. Other users' visible repositories are
still available through an explicit `agit new <owner/repo> -b <name>`.

Loading, unavailable, signed-out, and empty states explain what is happening.
Press `r` to retry Hub discovery or `q` to cancel, including while a request is
pending. Discovery makes a bounded authenticated read; it does not clone or
create repositories. Selecting a Hub row asks for an explicit branch name, then
uses the ordinary `new` command to clone and validate `--from` before creating
the local session. Its shared files and inheritance line are therefore marked
as unverified until cloning completes.

```text

```

* **The session count counts session lines only.** The `main` that `agit init`
  creates is a file line and never claims a session
  ([`03_branch_model.md`](03_branch_model.md) §1). Take the branch total as the
  session count and a freshly initialized repo with no sessions at all reads
  `1 session` — that trades "cannot be counted" for "counted wrong", and the
  second is harder to spot. A branch with no declared form does not count
  either: guessing one is worse than admitting it is unknown.
* **A read-only checkout is marked.** `new` on someone else's checkout is legal,
  but the user has to know that publishing goes through `agit push --mine`.
* **The inheritance point is whatever `--from` gives**, defaulting to the `main`
  file line. What the screen shows and what downstream actually inherits must be
  the same string. If that point is a session line, say so on the spot — "that
  is a fork carrying context, not a new" — and give the `agit fork` form; do not
  change the semantics silently.
* **A branch name gets no "press enter for the default".** `agit init` already
  set the rule: the directory name is a suggestion, and only typing it out
  counts. A duplicate name is caught the moment typing ends, not reported as an
  error at the very end.

### 3.3 `agit log` — the timeline

With no arguments, log first offers a session picker even when the directory
has no binding or adopted session. It uses the same saved-session list as share:
the current repository first, full repo and branch identities, and `/` filtering.
Enter opens the selected branch's timeline without pinning it. Explicit targets,
filters and output options keep the ordinary command-line path.

```text
┌ agit log ── nana/payments @ refund-fix ───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▸ # 14 3f2a1bc12 turn   18 events 4 ToolUse fix refund retry   6m ago   ⌂ v0.3    │

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 ↑↓ move  enter read  tab branches  / filter  q quit
```

`Tab` switches between "turn-by-turn" and "branch-level". The branch level lists
the name, turn count, opening prompt, last activity and ahead/behind; enter
there opens that branch's turn-by-turn history.

Turn activity counts the frozen LOG addition: `events` are stored envelope records
addressable by `#n.k`. The `ToolUse` column counts only IR `EventKind::ToolUse`;
`ToolResult` and `FileEdit` are excluded, including native file calls classified as
`FileEdit`. Each envelope supplies its source runtime. VIEW edits do not change
historical counts, and non-turn rows carry no activity counts.

Row width is budgeted in **columns**, not characters — a row of Chinese has half
as many characters as it has columns. When width runs short the yield order is
explicit: a turn row drops the message first, then the tag, and the time last; a
branch row drops the opening prompt first, then the time, then the line-form
marker, and only then narrows the name field. `#n`, the short sha, kind, activity,
branch turn count and `↑↓` **never yield** — the first of those are what you locate by (they
are what lets `agit show` reach that turn), and `↑↓` is the divergence warning,
which the user will not act on without seeing it.
If the terminal cannot fit those fields, the screen reports the required width;
large counts increase that requirement instead of being clipped.

### 3.4 The transcript — reading that conversation

`agit show --tui`, and enter from the timeline, land on the same screen: the
list on the left, the conversation on the right.

* enter reads **that turn**, the same content as `agit show <ref>#n`;
* a transcript is parsed on demand and cached, keyed by the row's own identity
  rather than by its position — filtering changes positions;
* parsing a turn is not instantaneous, so the screen paints a frame before it
  reads. A cleared screen sitting still reads as a hang;
* text no runtime recognizes is handed over unchanged. Blank reads as "this turn
  has no content" when the fact is that it was not understood.

### 3.5 `agit import` — adopt an existing conversation

With no arguments, import makes all three adoption stages explicit: the AgentGit
repo receiving the new line, the unmanaged runtime session under the current
directory, and the destination that names the branch and confirms the operation.
`Tab` and Enter advance one stage; `Shift-Tab` and Esc retreat one stage. Esc
quits only from the first stage. Arrows and `/` affect only the focused selection
pane, while the destination stage owns branch-name input. A user can always walk
back to either choice without losing it.

```text
┌ agit import ── nana @ agent-git.com ── ● 1 active ───────────────────┐
│ 1 repos          │ 2 sessions                 │ 3 destination       │
│ ▸ nana/payments  │ • codex a3f9c1…    6m ago │ repo   nana/payments│
│   12 sessions    │   fix the retry path       │ branch retry-fix_   │
│   einsia/infra   │   claude 7b21ee…   28s ago │ session codex a3f9… │
│   read-only      │   investigate import       │ active  6m ago       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 tab/enter next   shift-tab/esc back   ↑↓ move   / filter   q quit
```

At 120 columns and above, all three stages are side-by-side. Between 80 and 119
columns, repo and session remain side-by-side and destination moves below them.
Below 80 columns, one stage occupies the body at a time under an explicit stage
indicator. Resizing changes only presentation, never focus or selection. With
exactly one eligible repo, it is selected up front and the first focus is the
session stage; the user may still retreat to inspect it. With none, the repo
stage states that versioned adoption requires `agit init` and leaves
`link-only` available.

Each session row leads with the name the runtime itself shows for the session
when its index records one (Codex thread names), otherwise with runtime and
short id; the project directory, the opening prompt and relative last activity
follow, and the rows are ordered newest first. The id stays on the row either
way, because it is what `agit import <id>` names. Runtime bookkeeping such as
Codex approval and subagent threads or Claude Code sidechains is not offered;
an explicit id still imports it. A Codex deep link (`codex://threads/<id>`)
pasted into the filter selects exactly that thread, and `agit import` accepts
the same link in place of the id. "Last activity" is the runtime
index's update time when it provides one, otherwise the transcript's modified
time; it is not a separately recorded "last resumed" event. The `●` live marker
uses the same timestamp and conservative live window. A session that still
looks active is left for its own terminal to finish first.

`l` switches to `--link-only`, which needs neither sign-in nor a repo or branch;
the first stage is visibly skipped until versioned import is restored. The
session still advances to destination so the complete link operation is visible
before Enter confirms it. `/` filters the focused selection pane, so repo and
session queries never erase each other.

The screen creates nothing. It leaves the alternate screen and fills in the
ordinary `agit import <id> --from <runtime> --into <repo>@<branch>` arguments, or
the equivalent `--link-only` form. Its repository metadata reads are bounded and
local-only, and it does not refresh RC status or create the store. Selected Claude,
Codex, and Cursor previews read bounded opening windows from native transcripts.
OpenCode rows use indexed metadata without opening a selected-session snapshot or
creating an export cache.

An undecided versioned import then offers verified local lineage candidates,
independent import, and cancellation on the normal screen. Cancellation is the
initial choice even for a singleton candidate. Acceptance rereads the observed
source and target before, and under, the existing branch and claim locks.
Permission checks, branch creation, linking, and the opening settlement remain
on the command path.

### 3.6 `agit init` — create the file line

With no arguments, init opens a wizard for the repository name, directory
binding and optional project assets. The directory name is shown as a
suggestion but is never copied into the field: typing the name is the action
that chooses it. The owner is the signed-in account, or `local` while offline.

Seed selection is a separate checklist and begins empty. `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md` and discovered skills may contain private memory, so each item must
be selected explicitly. The wizard then leaves the alternate screen and the
ordinary init path performs conflict checks, creates `main`, copies exactly the
selected assets and binds the directory.

### 3.7 `agit config` — effective and stored values

With no arguments, config opens all supported global keys in one editor. Each
row names the source of its effective value: environment, stored, default or
unset. The detail pane keeps the effective and stored values on separate lines.
For `hub.url`, it also shows the current `AGIT_HUB_URL` value and explains when
that environment variable masks the file.

`Enter` edits the stored value through the command's existing value-domain
checks, and `u` removes it. An environment override remains effective after
either operation, so the screen never implies that changing `config.json` can
change the current process environment. Explicit key/value and `--list` forms
keep their command-line behavior.

### 3.8 `agit share` — choose a conversation and link settings

With no arguments, share lists settled sessions across local repositories.
Sessions in the current directory's repository appear first, then other
repositories, with the most recently saved first within each group. Every row
keeps the full `owner/repo@branch` visible as its identity. `/` filters by repo,
branch or runtime. Selection applies only to this command and changes no
workspace pin.

After choosing a session, the settings screen offers visibility, expiry, view
limit and an optional passphrase. Arrow keys move between fields; Left/Right,
Space or Enter change a setting. "Continue to confirmation" leaves the
alternate screen. The ordinary command scans the selected saved VIEW,
asks for a passphrase when enabled, and confirms the exact saved point and settings
before creating the link. Esc or `q` cancels without publishing.

The defaults are an encrypted link expiring after seven days. Both encrypted
and public links can be read by anyone who has the complete link; only the
encrypted form keeps the service from reading its content. The screen states
that distinction beside the visibility setting.

Explicit forms such as `agit share me/repo@work --expire 24h` retain their CLI
behavior. Saved points share their VIEW by default; `--full-log` deliberately
includes their complete LOG. `@` uses the explicit `AGIT_SESSION` selection.
Outside the TUI an omitted target requires that environment value; directory
bindings and discovered runtime sessions never supply an implicit replacement.

### 3.9 `agit push` — select the session to publish

With no target in a human terminal, push opens the saved-session picker. Enter
passes one explicit `owner/repo@branch` to the existing publishing path; `q`
cancels before signing in or contacting the Hub. `-b` and `--all` keep their
ordinary behavior and require an explicit repo or `AGIT_SESSION`.

`agit switch` and directory branch pins are removed. Ordinary commands use an
explicit argument or `AGIT_SESSION`; neither the only local repository nor the
only adopted conversation in a directory replaces that selection. Runtime
identity can reject a stale environment target but never silently substitutes
another branch. Directory bindings support setup, display and picker ordering.
A picker turns the user's selection into an explicit command argument without
changing persistent session context.

## 4. Two disciplines

### 4.1 The list does not parse transcripts

The cost of opening a screen must not grow linearly with the number of sessions,
branches or repos. List data therefore comes from metadata gathered without
parsing transcripts, and filtering never refetches it.

Import has two bounded exceptions. First, the shared naming collector checks the
most recent unindexed candidates within a fixed budget so abandoned empty
startup sessions do not fill the list; candidates beyond that budget stay
visible without being read. Second, Claude has no indexed opening prompt, and a
column of ids does not identify conversations to a person. The selected
candidate is parsed on demand and cached; moving the cursor may parse one more.
Codex supplies that preview from its index without opening the transcript, and
filtering never refetches either source.

The fetching layer stands on its own and **asks git in batches**: the cost of a
per-item `git show` is almost entirely process startup — on this machine 12
repos and 39 branches measure 1.19 seconds, against 0.17 seconds for two batched
`cat-file` runs.

"Filtering" acts only on rows already fetched. A `/` that triggers a full
recompute is the easiest trap in an interface like this.

### 4.2 Non-tty output does not change by a byte

The interface is a layer **in front**, not a rewrite of the command. When the
tests do not hold, the original path runs unchanged; when they do, the interface
only **fills in the arguments** and hands off to that same path.

So a pipe, CI, a script and an agent session see exactly what they see with no
interface at all — including the exit code, what goes to stderr, and whether
help text takes the error channel or standard output. A screen lands only once
every command has been compared byte for byte against the same command with the
interface off.

## 5. Keys

The same on every screen, nothing to relearn:

```text
↑↓ / j k    move                  g / G     first / last
enter       main action           tab       switch view (when a second exists)
/           filter                q / esc   quit
f / b       page (conversation)   ctrl-c    quit
page up/down  page (candidates)
```

The fallback import and resume candidate lists also use descending activity time across
runtimes and sources. Native index times take precedence for adopted sessions; an
unavailable native timestamp falls back to the link timestamp. Saved branches use
their head commit time, including packed refs. Ordering never selects an identity.

In the import and resume selectors and the naming inbox, PageUp and PageDown move by the visible
list height, including multiline candidate rows. They stay within the filtered
list and stop at its ends. Paging changes only the highlighted candidate; Enter
still confirms it, and resizing recalculates the next page from the new layout.

While a filter is being typed the footer keys change with it — there `q` goes
into the query, it does not quit. A footer still reading `q quit` is the screen
lying.

## 6. Turning it off

```bash
agit --no-tui log        # not this time
export AGIT_TUI=0        # not anywhere in this shell
agit --tui log           # yes inside an agent session (does not override --json / -q / -y)
```

`AGIT_TUI` is three-state: `1`/`true` on, `0`/`false` off, unset takes no
position. "Set to any value" does not count as on — `AGIT_TUI=0` is the most
natural way to write "turn it off", and reading it as "non-empty is true" turns
it into "on", the worst kind of counter-intuitive.

## 7. What is here and what is not

Here: session selection (bare `agit` / `agit resume`), repo selection
(`agit new`), the timeline (`agit log`), transcript reading (`agit show --tui`
and enter from the timeline), session adoption (`agit import`), repository
initialization (`agit init`), configuration (`agit config`), sharing
(`agit share`), and the terminal handoff running through all of them.

All zero-argument interface forms in this document now use the shared shell.

## 8. Runtime validation

Native session changes are tracked through the runtime's SessionStart event.
An existing adopted session is resolved by its runtime identity, including when
it is resumed from another directory; its recorded repo and branch are supplied
to the agent explicitly. Claude titles are preserved during startup, resume and
fork handling. Clear and compact events do not repeatedly ask for a title.
Unadopted conversations remain available in the naming inbox.

Turn commits retain a bounded description of the working directory's Git state.
When a resumed session has moved, has mismatched or unknown Git state, or opens
outside a Git repository, an environment notice is supplied automatically to
the runtime. A matching dirty summary is still only a coarse observation and
does not prove that the changed files have identical contents. The notice does
not check out files, stash changes, or restore the code repository.

The Codex hook contract has an executable end-to-end probe at
[`../scripts/codex-hook-probe.py`](../scripts/codex-hook-probe.py). It creates
an isolated home, installs the hooks through `agit setup`, starts one real
managed Codex turn, captures the `SessionStart` and `Stop` payloads, and checks
that the Stop hook advances the selected AgentGit branch. It also runs Codex
with a non-default `CODEX_HOME`, which keeps session discovery, hook
installation, and transcript settlement on the same configured root.

Run it after building the debug binary:

```bash
cargo build
scripts/codex-hook-probe.py
```

The probe requires an installed Codex CLI with hooks enabled and an existing
Codex login. It copies only `auth.json` into a temporary directory and removes
that directory on exit. AgentGit uses a temporary local-only author identity;
the probe neither copies AgentGit credentials nor contacts an AgentGit Hub.
