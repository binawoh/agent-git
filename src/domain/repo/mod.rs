//! repo: `~/.agit/repos/<owner>/<name>/`, one git repository.
//!
//! # Why this has to be git
//!
//! An agent's version history must be git, because the backend moves content over gitsync
//! smart-http (there is no API for uploading transcripts). Version ids are tags:
//!
//! ```text
//! refs/heads/main              the default branch (the file line)
//! refs/heads/<branch>          other branches
//! refs/tags/agit-<40hex>       one version
//! session/meta.json            session metadata for this commit (with the layout version)
//! LOG / VIEW                   the ordered v1 event-id sequence (absent on the file line)
//! events/a/b/c/d/<event-id>    the full v1 envelope objects (absent on the file line)
//! memory/  skills/  AGENTS.md  shared files
//! ```
//!
//! **The only copy of the content on this machine is here.** `agit commit` writes straight into
//! this repository's working tree and makes one git commit; `agit push` is `git push`. Nothing
//! stages in between. A staging layer under `~/.agit/drafts/<agent>/` breaks two things: the draft
//! is deleted once push succeeds, so the next commit loses its comparison baseline, and the hint
//! "if the tag push fails, run `agit push` again" becomes impossible to follow (what would be
//! re-pushed is already gone). With the directory layout identical to git's, both failures are
//! structurally impossible.
//!
//! # Two remotes, in git's own words
//!
//! ```text
//! origin     your copy on the hub (pushes go here)
//! upstream   the source (fetch new work, resolve where a parent came from)
//! ```
//!
//! There is no third concept: `.git/config` already persists both, and agit only sets them and
//! reads them. The three kinds of repository configure their remotes like this:
//!
//! | How it came to be | origin | upstream |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | built by your own `agit import` | your copy | none |
//! | `agit clone alice/photo` | **alice's copy** (not pushable) | none |
//! | `agit clone alice/photo --mine` | your own copy of it | alice's copy |
//!
//! A read-only clone deliberately sets no `upstream`: its `origin` is the source, and a second
//! remote pointing at the same place only stops "has an `upstream`" from meaning "this copy is
//! mine".
//!
//! **`@{upstream}` is not this `upstream`.** The former is git's "which remote branch does the
//! current branch track" (usually `origin/main`), and [`Repo::ahead_behind`] uses it; the latter is
//! a remote named `upstream`. Adding the latter does not change the former — the shared name is
//! git's own historical baggage, not a choice made here.
//!
//! Contrast [`crate::domain::store::Store`] — that is only a directory of links, not a repository.
//! The two are separate because they answer different questions: the store records "which sessions
//! this machine tracks", the repo holds "one agent's version history and content".
//!
//! Authenticated git operations (`clone` / `fetch` / `push`) do not live here; they live in
//! [`crate::hub::git`] — authentication is the hub's business.

/// - `git replace --graft <tip>` (with no parent): the parent pointer is swapped out.
///   `rev-list --branches` collapses the whole history into a single line, and the commits deep in
///   it **cannot even be enumerated**.
///
/// The refspec of [`crate::commands::push`] is `refs/heads/<branch>` and `refs/tags/*`, **not**
/// `refs/replace/*` — the replacement never leaves this machine and what goes out is the real
/// object. So the local gate reads the replacement, reports clean, and lets it through, while the
/// secret travels intact over the network and lands on the hub. This is not "the client erring on
/// the conservative side"; it points the other way.
///
/// Nor is this only an attack surface: `git filter-repo` and `git replace --graft` both leave
/// `refs/replace/*` behind, and a repository whose secrets were just scrubbed with filter-repo has
/// exactly this shape.
///
/// # Why a command-line flag and not `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS=1`
///
/// The two are equivalent, but **a typo fails in opposite directions**: misspell the flag → git

    /// # Why not `--batch-command`
    ///
    /// The `info` / `contents` subcommands of `cat-file --batch-command` do the filtering and the

    /// in git **2.36**, while this product's pinned floor is **2.28** (README and
    /// `docs/01_setup.md` both say so, for the reason in [`Repo::init`]: Ubuntu 20.04 ships 2.25).
    /// Lifting the floor from 2.28 to 2.36 to spare one process buys some users a scan that will
    /// not run at all — and a gate that cannot run is no gate.
    ///
    /// As for "why not reuse the `--batch-check` of the estimating pass on the same batch": that
    /// pass is a **gate**, and it has to complete in full before any body is read (over budget, not
    /// one object is read); keeping its result around for the scanning pass means holding an
    /// `oid → length` table of the same order as the repository, which is exactly what
    /// `OBJECT_BATCH` exists to avoid. What is reused is this **function**, not the result of one
    /// of its calls.
    ///
    /// # Why framing is by length and not by separator
    ///
    /// Because **an object's body may contain any byte**, including whichever one you pick as the
    /// separator. A NUL inside a commit body is not a theoretical possibility:
    /// `git hash-object -t commit --literally` makes one, and `git push` accepts it (stock git only
    /// records it in `fsck`, as `nulInCommit`). Split on a separator and the record breaks at the
    /// first NUL, the suffix is taken as the start of the next record, and everything after that is
    /// off by one — **and nothing errors**. One such object lets every object behind it slip
    /// silently out of the scan surface.
    ///
    /// Each `cat-file --batch` record is `<oid> <kind> <bytes>\n<body>\n`: the body is taken by
    /// that byte count, independent of what the body holds. Finding the header line's own boundary
    /// by `\n` is safe — it consists only of hex, a type name and decimal digits. (The tag path is
    /// the same, framing by `%(raw:size)`.)
    ///
    /// # stdin has to be written from another thread
    ///
    /// `cat-file --batch` **reads stdin and writes stdout at the same time**. Writing every OID
    /// first and only then reading deadlocks once there are enough OIDs: git stops to wait for us
    /// to read once its stdout pipe is full, while we are blocked writing stdin, each waiting on
    /// the other. So the write goes in another thread and this thread only reads.
