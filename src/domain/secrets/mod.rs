//! Secret scanning.
//!
//! # Why the gate is at push
//!
//! A session transcript records what the agent actually read and ran, so `cat .env`,
//! `export TOKEN=...` and an API key pasted into the conversation are all in it. `push` is the
//! moment **content first leaves this machine**, so the gate sits here.
//!
//! The client warns before content leaves the machine. Public pushes and private-to-public
//! transitions also receive a strict server scan. An authenticated caller can explicitly
//! accept credential findings with the publication workflow; incomplete server scans still
//! prevent publication. Private pushes remain subject to the local check.
//!
//! `AGIT_ALLOW_SECRETS` affects local checking only. The push command's `--allow-secrets` option
//! also communicates explicit acceptance to a supporting server for that operation.
//!
//! Settlement projects discovered values through the local repository dictionary before
//! forming canonical objects. Publication independently inspects retained history and direct
//! Git writes; protecting a new snapshot cannot remove secrets in its ancestors.
//!
//! # Err toward the false positive
//!
//! Uncertain token-like values become reversible repository placeholders. Independent entropy
//! discovery and provider rules share the same inspection surface; neither is exhaustive.
//!
//! # Same source on both sides, different authority
//!
//! The rule engine lives in `domain` (not behind the `cli` feature), so a backend depending on
//! this crate with `default-features = false` runs the same rules. But **the authority differs**:
//! inline `agit:allow-secret` and the local allowlist are "do not stop me" switches that hold
//! locally, and the server-side gate honours neither — otherwise anyone could push a secret by
//! writing an annotation on their own line. The switch is [`Policy`]: the client uses
//! [`Policy::CLIENT`], the server uses [`Policy::STRICT`].
//!
//! # Upgrading the vendored rules
//!
//! Copy gitleaks' `config/gitleaks.toml` over `gitleaks.toml`, keep the provenance / MIT comment
//! at the top of the file and update the version, then run `cargo test --lib domain::secrets` —
//! `every_rule_compiles` tells you whether there is a new rule Rust's `regex` cannot compile.

/// sitting in a working-tree file, `agit scan --secrets` says clean while `agit push` stops the
/// very same one — and the user cannot reproduce locally why they were refused.
///
/// Two entry points drift as long as they both exist, and the drift is always one of them missing
/// something. So there is one: "scan and push reach the same verdict" is no longer a promise held
/// up by discipline, it is the same code.
///
/// For the surface see [`in_publish_surface`]: the session itself (`session/log.jsonl`,
/// `session/VIEW`), the shared files (`memory/`, `skills/`, `AGENTS.md`, ...) and commit messages
/// not yet pushed.
///
/// The allowlist lives in `$AGIT_HOME` (it must not be published with the repo) rather than in
/// the repo: folding it into one parameter makes the allowlist fail silently — a false positive
/// could not be allowed, and a gate with no way to allow one ends up switched off entirely.
///
/// The four paths (working-tree files, reachable blobs, commit objects, tag objects) share **one**
/// [`HitCollector`], so the combined total is bounded too — capping each path separately and then
/// adding them makes the bound "number of paths × cap", and that multiplier grows quietly as the
/// next path is added.
///
/// # Why both the working tree and the git objects are scanned
///
/// The two answer different questions, and dropping either opens a door:
///
/// * **The working tree** is the only place a secret can be stopped **before** it enters history
///   — content not yet `git add`ed is in no tree.
/// * **The reachable objects** are the only way to guarantee "what is scanned is exactly the
///   bytes about to leave this machine". Working-tree content comes from a checkout, and checkout
///   honours `refs/replace/*`: once a clean replacement tree is materialized by
///   `git reset --hard`, the working tree holds not one byte of the secret while the tree pushed
///   is the real one. And the working tree is only **this one snapshot**, while push sends the
///   whole unpushed history. `rev-list` / `cat-file` go through
///   [`crate::domain::repo::Repo`] with `--no-replace-objects`, so what they read is always the
///   real object.
///
/// The union, not one or the other: either side alone is a gate that can be bypassed, or bypassed
/// ahead of time. One hit from each side is **not** a duplicate: the way out for the working-tree
/// one is an inline annotation, the way out for the blob in history is rewriting history, and
/// collapsing them into one drops one of the two ways out.
///
/// # Why it takes no ref argument
///
/// Because the publish surface is not a function of "the ref the user typed on the command line".
/// One `agit push` pushes `refs_to_push(branches, has_main)` plus the tags they reach — `-b` can
/// be given several times, `--all` is everything with updates, and main is appended
/// unconditionally whenever it exists locally.
///
/// Scanning per ref is wrong in both directions:
///
/// * **Missing**: `agit scan other` checks only `other`'s tree, while `agit push -b other` also
///   carries `main`. With the secret in a current file on `main` and `other` clean, a standalone
///   scan says clean while push stops it — and the user cannot reproduce locally why they were
///   refused.
/// * **Duplicated**: hanging the repository-level paths inside a per-ref loop makes
///   `agit scan main other` scan and report the same hits twice, each stamped with that round's
///   target, pointing at a ref that has nothing to do with them.
///
/// The only thing that varies is the **destination** ([`ScanPlan::dest`]), and that is not a ref:
/// it answers "what does the far side already have", while the `--branches` side does not change

///
/// The enumeration step of [`scan_publish_blobs`] **cannot tell trees apart**: `rev-list

/// inflates it, fills the pipe, this process reads it to length, and **only then** is it dropped
/// on that one `kind != "blob"` line. The bytes already flowed.
///
/// So "trees are never counted" would not describe what this code does: a repo with small blobs
/// and large trees (a directory of a few million entries is enough) estimates to those few blob
/// bytes, comfortably inside the budget, while what actually flows through `cat-file` adds the
/// whole pile of tree bytes and can be an order of magnitude larger — "read no object at all when
/// over budget" would not be kept by a word, and the duration goes back to being a function of
/// repo size. And this undercount does not need an adversarial construction to meet: v1's
/// `events/a/b/c/d/<id>` rewrites a five-level tree chain on every commit, so tree bytes grow on
/// the same order as the blob bytes this bound was calibrated against.
///
/// The **root** tree is not counted, the other way round: its enumeration line has an empty path
/// and [`scan_publish_blobs`] skips it itself, so counting it is dishonesty in the other
/// direction (bytes nobody reads pushed into the budget, large enough to keep a good repo out).
/// The test comes straight from the enumeration line's path, sharing a source with that side —
/// written once on each side they drift apart sooner or later.
///
/// # Tags need **a second enumeration**
///
/// Adding `"tag"` to the `kind` test alone says nothing: the selector is `--branches` (see
/// [`Destination::revs`]) and an annotated tag object is **unreachable** from a branch —
/// `rev-list --objects --branches` lists no tag at all. So this enumerates again under the same
/// test [`scan_tag_objects`] uses (`for-each-ref --merged <branches…> refs/tags`).
///
/// Only the ones with `objecttype == tag` are counted: the commit a lightweight tag points at was
/// already counted by the previous pass under `--merged`, and counting it again is double
/// billing.
///
/// `spent` is the byte count the working-tree pass already read, used as the **starting point**:
/// the budget covers the whole scan surface, not half of it.
///
/// Reaching the budget **stops the enumeration** (`--batch-check` is not free either), so the
/// return value is a lower bound once the limit is crossed. The verdict only cares whether it
/// went over, for which a lower bound is enough; when the number is printed it is said as "at

/// The subtracted half comes from [`Destination`] — **what the destination itself reported**, not

/// selector comes from [`Destination::revs`] alone, and the commit path uses the same one (a test
/// written once on each path produces, inside one push, the mismatch "commits scanned over the

///
/// Every object goes through [`crate::domain::repo::Repo`] with `--no-replace-objects`, so
/// `refs/replace/*` fools neither the enumeration nor the read.

/// # This pass filters by path not at all
///
/// The path `rev-list --objects` puts on a blob line is only a **label**: a blob gets one, and
/// when the same content appears at several paths which one is kept depends purely on traversal
/// order. Using it as a filter therefore makes a secret lying at both `session/meta.json` and
/// `skills/leak.md` disappear **entirely** because the label landed on the former — the in-surface
/// copy never gets its turn to be scanned, and it leaves with the push all the same. A gate's
/// verdict must not depend on the lexicographic order of file names.
///
/// So **neither** of [`in_publish_surface`]'s two exclusions is kept here:
///
/// * **`session/meta.json`** — its exclusion is **defensive and load-bearing for nothing**: a
///   canonical meta matches `[]` under the current rule set (observed; fixed fields plus a 40-hex
///   identity trip no rule).
///
///   Recognizing it by **content** instead (bytes compared to the canonical serialization) widens
///   an exclusion that belonged to one path into a **global** one: any blob whose bytes look like
///   a canonical meta is skipped, and those bytes can be constructed on purpose — put the secret
///   in `milestone`, save it as `skills/deploy/config.json`, and the scan says clean while push
///   sends it. A test that solves nothing and can be worn as a costume is only harmful.
///
///   Should a future entropy-based generic rule make session identities false-positive, what
///   changes then is the rule or the allowlist, not a hole in the scan surface keyed on the shape
///   of content.
///
/// * **`.git/*`** — it guards the working-tree walkdir against descending into a real `.git`
///   directory (local state: config, hooks, packed objects), and **there is no local state among
///   the reachable objects**: a tree entry named `.git` is not something ordinary git produces,
///   while one forced in with plumbing really is bytes that leave with a push. Excluding it here
///   opens a path an attacker can aim at.
///
/// # How the cost is contained
///
/// `rev-list --objects` lists every historical object on a large repo's first push, so every
/// layer has to be bounded:
///
/// 1. **Streaming enumeration**: through `git_stream_split`, holding one record at a time, so the
///    output never enters memory in one piece.
/// 2. **A bounded OID list**: once [`OBJECT_BATCH`] is full it goes to one `cat-file --batch` and
///    is cleared, so what is resident is independent of history length.
/// 3. **Stop when full**: as soon as the collector fills, [`EnoughHits`] aborts `rev-list` (the
///    child process is killed) rather than "read it all and throw it away".
/// 4. **A bounded output per carrier**: each blob's `cap` is `out.remaining()`, so even a large
///    file matching on every line does not materialize `Hit`s on the order of its line count
///    before the collector takes over (see [`scan_text_capped`]).
/// 5. **A bounded single object**: an object over [`ScanLimits::max_object_bytes`] is not read at
///    all and is recorded in [`Unscanned::oversized`] (see
///    [`crate::domain::repo::ObjectBody`]).
/// 6. **Bounded total work**: the whole batch's byte count is estimated first by
///    [`estimate_object_bytes`], and over budget means no object is read.
///
/// None of the first four counts **work**: 1 and 2 only keep the input out of memory in one

/// Without this, the server-side gate refuses (it scans tags) while the local `agit scan` says
/// clean — and the user cannot reproduce locally why they were refused. The direction is safe
/// (the server is stricter), but "scanned, and clean" is then false, and that is the one lie a
/// scanner must never tell.
///
/// # Which tags are scanned
///
/// The same test as push: **the ones reachable from the branches being pushed**
/// (`git tag --merged <branch>`, see `commands::push::tags_to_push`). Not all of `--tags` —
/// version numbers on branches that were not selected are not pushed anyway, and scanning them
/// only reports hits the user can neither understand nor act on.
///
/// The scan surface and the publish surface sharing a source is the one thing to hold here: a
/// test written once on each side drifts apart sooner or later, and the drift is always a miss.
///
/// # Why the bodies no longer come all at once from `for-each-ref %(raw)`
///
/// As `git_bytes(for-each-ref --format=…%(raw))`, **the bodies of every reachable tag** land in
/// one `Vec<u8>` at once and each is then copied into a `String` by `from_utf8_lossy`. The two
/// problems are one:
///
/// * **[`ScanLimits::max_object_bytes`] does not apply** — the call site is not even passed
///   `limits`. The same bytes in a different carrier flip the verdict (observed): a 200 MiB
///   annotated tag goes through the whole pass at maxRSS 610 MiB, reports `clean scan` and is
///   booked nowhere, while a 66 MiB blob is refused and recorded in [`Unscanned::oversized`].
/// * **Reading it all at once is itself another unbounded allocation.** And large tag counts are
///   **normal** in this product: agit cuts a version tag every turn, so hundreds of turns are
///   hundreds of tags. "Each one bounded" does not fix "all of them read at once".
///
/// So it is exactly the same shape as blobs and commits: streaming enumeration
/// ([`stream_tag_object_oids`], whose output is only oids and types, independent of body size),
/// and OIDs handed to one [`crate::domain::repo::Repo::git_cat_file_batch`] once
/// [`OBJECT_BATCH`] fills, then cleared. The peak is therefore "the largest objects within one
/// batch", not "how large all the tags are together".
///
/// The framing precondition also returns to the sturdiest one: the enumeration step outputs only
/// hex and type names, so splitting on `\n` is unambiguous; bodies are taken by the **byte
/// count** git reports itself, so a NUL or non-UTF-8 inside a body changes nothing (framing
/// `%(raw)` by hand on `%(raw:size)` existed precisely to deal with those two).
