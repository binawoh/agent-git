//! claude-code driver — `stream-json` over stdio.
//!
//! # The exact invocation, and why each flag is there
//!
//! ```text
//! claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --verbose
//!        --include-partial-messages      token deltas, else the page only updates per block
//!        --replay-user-messages          our own messages come back on the stream, so every
//!                                        viewer sees what the driver typed (multi-viewer needs this)
//!        --permission-prompt-tool stdio  MEASURED: without it the CLI applies local settings and
//!                                        never asks. With it, every tool call arrives as a
//!                                        `can_use_tool` control request carrying full input.
//!        --permission-mode default       never `bypassPermissions` unless the caller asked
//!        --session-id <uuid>             we choose the id, so the transcript path is known up front
//!        [--resume <uuid>]               continue an existing session
//! ```
//!
//! # Measured behaviour (this is the part you cannot read off a doc page)
//!
//! Against `claude` 2.1.233 on this machine:
//!
//! * A `can_use_tool` request looks like
//!   `{"type":"control_request","request_id":"…","request":{"subtype":"can_use_tool","tool_name":"Write","input":{…},"permission_suggestions":[…],"tool_use_id":"toolu_…"}}`
//!   and the answer is
//!   `{"type":"control_response","response":{"subtype":"success","request_id":"…","response":{"behavior":"deny","message":"…"}}}`.
//!   A denial with a message is delivered to the model as an `is_error` tool
//!   result, and it explains itself in the next turn rather than silently retrying.
//! * `{"type":"control_request","request":{"subtype":"interrupt"}}` genuinely
//!   aborts an in-flight `sleep 30`; the transcript gets a
//!   `[Request interrupted by user]` user line and the process exits non-zero.
//! * A second user message written mid-turn is **accepted immediately but
//!   delivered only when the running tool call returns** (measured: written at
//!   4.00 s during a `sleep 30`, appeared in the stream at 35.06 s, and counted
//!   into the *same* turn — `num_turns=2`, no new turn). Hence
//!   [`Delivery::AtToolBoundary`]: the UI must show "queued", or on a weak
//!   network the user assumes it was lost and sends it three more times.
