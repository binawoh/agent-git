//! Runtime adapter layer.
//!
//! # Why an intermediate representation
//!
//! The two runtimes' on-disk formats are completely different. Without an IR, every feature
//! (rendering, search, sharing, cross-runtime resume) is written twice, and a third runtime
//! means touching all of them.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Claude Code jsonl ──parse──┐
//!                              ├──> Session (IR) ──render──> any format
//!   Codex rollout jsonl ─parse─┘
//! ```
//!
//! # The IR is deliberately small
//!
//! It keeps only what both runtimes can express and what the layers above actually use.
//! Encrypted reasoning and vendor-proprietary tool encodings have no counterpart; they are
//! marked `Other` and dropped in conversion — that loss is **explicit** (it gets reported), not
//! silent.
//!
//! This is also why the store keeps the **raw** jsonl rather than the IR: the IR is a lossy
//! projection, good for rendering and search, unfit as the source of truth. The line in the docs
//! — "any compression or distillation loses the part that is hardest to rebuild, namely 'why not
//! that way'" — is about exactly this.
