//! AgentGit hub HTTP client.
//!
//! # The hub address
//!
//! The default is the public hub (`config::DEFAULT_HUB_URL`): it works as soon as it is
//! installed, with no environment variable to set first. A self-hosted instance or local
//! development overrides it with `AGIT_HUB_URL`:
//!
//! ```bash
//! AGIT_HUB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8177 agit push    # a hub started locally
//! AGIT_HUB_URL=https://hub.corp.com  agit push    # self-hosted
//! ```
//!
//! Credentials are stored per address, so moving between hubs does not mean signing in again.
//!
//! # The server answers "which agent this repo picks up"
//!
//! No file in the code repo records the binding. `agit clone` with no argument calls
//! `/api/agents/for-repo` and lets the server look it up in reverse; the server intersects that
//! against **the scope the current user may access** and returns a candidate list.
