/// # Why the test lives **here** and not in `push`
///
/// Because "may the destination shrink the scan surface" is one question, not two. Written into

/// the checkout it selected (`checkout.name`, the same name `ensure_remote` creates or fetches),
/// `agit scan` from the slug it resolved. It is the third segment of the destination identity —
/// it **must not** be derived here from `origin`, which is handing the suspect URL its own alibi.
